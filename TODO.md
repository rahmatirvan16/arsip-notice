# TODO: Modify api_client.php to Standalone API Client Example

## Tasks
- [x] Modify api_client.php to remove session checks, navbar, sidebar, and make it a standalone page for API testing without login
- [x] Update router.php to allow direct access to api_client.php without requiring login
- [x] Test the modified api_client.php by accessing it directly and verifying PDF search and viewing functionality (Server needs to be started manually with 'php -S localhost:8000 router.php')
